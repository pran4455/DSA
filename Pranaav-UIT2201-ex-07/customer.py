"""

This module provides a series of functions that calculate the
value of a polynomial, given the polynomial coefficient terms
and the value of x in 3 different time complexities, namely
O(n^2), O(nlogn) and O(n). This is a part of the exercises
given under the course UIT2201 (Programming and Data Structures).

In this source code I have executed my own logic. The code
follows good coding practices.

Your comments and suggestions are welcome.
